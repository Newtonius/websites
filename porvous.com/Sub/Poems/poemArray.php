			From Aisa, to Europe, to Africa, and more,<br/>
			all types of people from the places we'll explore!<br/><br/>

			We'll eat a croissant in France, as delicious as you ;)<br/>
			and craft the finest of Necklaces, trained by the Zulu!<br/><br/>

			The world isn't ready for us, it's shaking its knees!<br/>
			Or perhaps it's hungry, in that case let's get some Chinese.<br/><br/>

			We're gonna have a wild adventa no matter where we go.<br/>
			Like dancing in the Rio Carnival, in just a bird dress and speedo!<br/><br/>

			This poem is quick and poorly written,<br/>
			but at least it wasn't made in Britain!<br/><br/>

			Take care out there my love, I want you back whole!<br/>

			Hoorah to your ovaries and nipples that get tender!<br/><br/>

			Women go through a great deal, that's no lie.<br/>
			While us men only worry about our tie.<br/><br/>

			How can one say you don't, you practically build humans,<br/>
			9 months in an oven -geeze that's hotter than spiced cumin!<br/><br/>

			Men holler and oggle, our behaviour is alarming...<br/>
			But you, a woman, graceful and rivetting -And might I also add charming ;)-.<br/><br/>

			Today we celebrate all women around the globe<br/>
			But mostly I celebrate you, the woman who tantazlizes my every lobe ^.^<br/>
			Happy international woman's day my love!",

			If ever a man had wished to dream<br>
			to escape his dreary world that did not gleam,<br>
			he would place his head down to rest;<br>
			to escape life's torments, its horrors, its test.<br><br>

			there was no resolute, no escape, no plan.<br>
			In the darkness of man do all things lay dead,<br> 
			life but a nimble pin, pierced heart with<br>
			death's thread<br><br>
			But upon that thread, the thread of life<br>
			there is always that moment, the moment of strife.<br>

			have another dream of life, in reality perchance.<br><br>
			From every corner of the world to every turn of the street,<br>
			warm tender love is life's only beat.<br>
			All young birds soon set flight, and thus, set free,<br>
			This felt true when I saw her and she saw me.<br><br>
			I saw, her face, her smile, her big gargantuan head,<br>
			her brain full of wonders, ideas, love, and dread.<br>
			But I now give her my body, my ideas, my words,<br>
			dreams come hither last, past come one last time, death has no more power<br>
			eternity I rest, flying with another bird<br><br>
			I saw her and she saw me, I'm finally free, me and<br>

			"Post-card image of my dear desire.<br>
			Leaves me daunting at future and the past,<br>
			thus in limbo passion set on fire.<br>
			Washing dishes even sounds like a blast.<br><br>
			I wait like a rock on a summer beach-<br>
			washed by the waves of the worlds love and fear<br>
			and so underwater does my heart reach<br>
			and when above water my heart is near.<br><br>
			She reaches for me for I reach to her.<br>
			Two rocks on the beach, frozen and drowning<br>
			they rise above just to see their lover<br>
			thine own eyes has seen the light, her smiling.<br><br>
			Post-card image leave my mangled heart be,<br>
			for it is animate love I shall see.",

			The flower had become an only means of sanctuary,<br>
