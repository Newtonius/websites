            <h2><u>Chapter 1: And Along came Adventa</u></h2>
            <p style="line-height: 30px;">
                Once upon a time, a 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp0"] ?></span>
                by the name of Heidi wanted to see the world.
                and whenever Heidi felt 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp1"] ?></span>, she would look to her pet
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp2"] ?></span> and say, 
                "I'll get out there, one day Mr. 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp3"] ?></span>.
                I'll see every sight, adventure every adventure, taste every ice-cream flavor this 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp4"] ?></span> filled world has to offer!"
                <br /><br />

                One day, as Heidi was 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp5"] ?></span> home, an explosion
                was heard in the distance. Instead of running away form the sound, Heidi's 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp6"] ?></span> instincts kicked in, coursing her head-on towards
                the explosion. She ran as fast as she could, heels kicking the air, her golden 
                hair boldly swaying on her head, and daring eyes that call out to the world intrepidly.
                After passing through hordes of people struck with fear, their eyes
                darting in the direction of shelter, Heidi finally arrived to the scene and at the epicenter of the 
                explosion, a crater depressed and cracked into the concrete of the street,
                the silhouette of a mysterious figure could be seen through the mist and rubble.
                <br /><br />
                
                Heidi stands there as seconds pass, the mist starts to clear and the figure becomes ever more visible.
                her eyes fix to the center for her 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp7"] ?></span> curiosity can take the suspense no longer!
                The mist clears and the figure reveals to be a man standing upright examining his surrounding.
                His suit made of 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp8"] ?></span>, 
                his hair black as the forbidden night, chest protruding outwards defensively, and his eyes -brown and piercing-
                meet with the 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp9"] ?></span>
                stare of Heidi's.
                <br /><br />
                
                The man begins to   
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp10"] ?></span>
                towards her fearlessly.
                Heidi finds herself immobilized by her 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp11"] ?></span>, and yet as the man gets closer, Heidi begins to move 
                back slowly. But unaware of her surrounds she trips over debris, and falls on her backside.
                She's Vulnerable, and the man's proximity becomes shorter as he speeds faster towards her!
                Heidi, never losing focus, continues to stare into the 
                <span class="getWord"><?php echo $_GET["inp12"] ?></span> 
                brown eyes of the man as he approaches her.
                At the final meters of their distance, the man starts to appear as the end for Heidi and she instinctively 
                raises her arms to defend herself, contemplating all the dreams she's ever only dreamed thus retreating to her safe place,
                awaiting death... 
                <br /><br />
                
                Everything becomes silent. Only the ambient sounds of sirens and escaping steam can be heard. Heidi's arms shaking, her eyes 
                shut-tight.
                The figure has stopped just in front of Heidi. He leans down and breaks the silence,<br /> "Don't be scared, everything will be okay.
                Show me your eyes." the man says gently. 
                Heidi slowly lowers her arms and opens her eyes seeing the man kneeling before her. Heidi stares into the eyes
                of the man and he thusly stares back, and in mere seconds the man's eyes open widely and his mouth drops, he utters astonishingly,<br />
                "A millenia of searching, finally over! What everybody's been searching for, finally found!.. And there it is, there you are.."
                <br /><br />
                "What? What is it, what do I have?!"<br /> Exclaims Heidi.
                <br /><br />
                "The eyes of the universe" The man says firmly.
                <br /><br />
                "What? What does that mean?" Heidi asks.
                <br /><br />
                The man stands up, leans down to offer his hand, and with a smile on his face says,<br />
                "It means you're one, the one we've all been waiting for. Are you ready for an adventure, Heidi?"
                <br /><br />
                Heidi looks at the man's hand and everything ti could represent. She shakingly reaches for it, grabs it, and nods only once.
                "I'm ready."
